        "title": "Early Non-Fiction Film",
        "content": "The following passage is adapted from a 2001 article by a film historian.\n\nIn exhibiting works of art whether in a gallery, a cinema, or anywhere else the primary question usually is: which works should be exhibited together? In many exhibitions the selection is often tied to the creator of the works. For example, we might have an exhibition of Rembrandt's paintings. Another reasonable method might be to choose paintings with a particular theme or of a particular historical period, for example, Modernism. In all cases the aim is to select a series of works with something in common. In the world of cinema, this notion of \"collecting the similar\" has its analogue in the retrospective. This involves collecting together and screening several examples of the work of a particular director, star, studio, etc. In recent years a rediscovery of early (pre-1915) nonfiction film has been taking place, and such films have been the subject of some notable retrospectives.\n\nBut I would argue that the philosophy of \"collecting the similar\" is often inappropriate for screening early film, especially nonfiction, because it means showing several films of the same type one after the other in the same sitting, which would never have been the practice at the time the films were made. Gathering together several short films (and in the early 1910s most films were under fifteen minutes) by the same maker or studio, while useful for historians and academics, is often profoundly dull for the viewer. With some exceptions, nonfiction films have always been supporting films, not main attractions. Early cinemagoers never saw a collection of similar films screened together; they almost always saw a program that was a mix of everything from dramas and comedies to travelogues and news. Even into the 1920s a mixed program was the norm.\n\nFilm archives and retrospective festivals often behave as if the production of the films were the only side of the coin. Film archives spend vast amounts of time and effort in restoring films as they supposedly were when originally produced. These restorations are presented with great fanfare as authentic versions, or \"directors' cuts.\" Yet as far as the exhibition side is concerned, authenticity is sometimes allowed to go out the window. Films are presented in an inauthentic setting, utterly shorn of the program that once gave these films life and context, a setting that allowed particular films to shine, but also to balance and react against other kinds of films. Film presenters discovered the magic of programming in the early years of the twentieth century, or more likely inherited it from the vaudeville tradition. It ill behooves us alleged early film lovers to forsake their insights today.",

        "title": "International Water Law",
        "content": "With rapidly expanding populations, growing industrial development, and dwindling water supplies on national and regional levels, water is fast replacing oil as the world's most valuable resource. Meanwhile, the growing importance of water in geopolitical affairs has increased the potential for international conflict over water resources. Thus as development and other threats to the world's rivers have continued to mount, nations have become acutely aware of the need for legal and institutional mechanisms to manage and protect resources that traverse their borders. Recognition of the need for international cooperation in efforts to manage and protect rivers has led the United Nations' International Law Commission (ILC) to develop a treaty structure for the uses of international watercourses. The ILC's Draft Articles on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses are an attempt to codify the customary principles of international water law as those principles are manifested in past legal decisions and currently accepted international practice. The Draft Articles are intended as a set of guidelines for the creation of treaties governing the use of specific international watercourses. They prescribe that treaties should uphold several broad precepts: that one nation's use of a watercourse should not cause appreciable harm to another nation, that every nation's use of the watercourse should be equitable and reasonable, and that nations should work for the protection of ecosystems.\n\nThough the Draft Articles are a significant step forward in the formulation of legal principles for the protection and regulation of international rivers, they are inadequate because they do not provide satisfactory ways of dealing with possible future environmental changes. One significant environmental threat to the world's rivers is the increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide. With its resultant greenhouse effect and warmer temperatures, it is likely to have a number of dramatic effects on water levels in international river systems, arising from increased runoff due to snowmelt or, more importantly, from decreased precipitation in many regions.\n\nTreaties that allocate fixed amounts of water to various countries based on current usage, as suggested by the Draft Articles, will not be flexible enough to respond to these large fluctuations in river flows. Once specific water rights are allocated along a river in accordance with the Draft Articles, nations would have no mechanism for coping with a drastic reduction in the flow of the river. Adhering rigidly to these fixed allocations would unjustly favor those countries whose water usage is most extensive. One way to circumvent this problem is to devise treaties that apportion water use in more flexible ways—for example, by assigning proportional shares rather than fixed allotments of water. Similarly, treaties might incorporate explicit contingency plans dealing specifically with issues related to possible climate changes, such as how reduced flows will be allocated among countries sharing a river.",

        "content": "This passage was adapted from an article published in 2000.\n\nCompetition to make computer chips smaller and, consequently, faster and more efficient has driven a technological revolution, fueled economic growth, and rapidly made successive generations of computers obsolete. Yet at the current rate of progress this march toward miniaturization will hit a wall by about 2010—for many, an unthinkable prospect. The laws of physics dictate that, with current methods, properly functioning transistors—the electronic devices that make up computer chips—cannot be made smaller than 25 nanometers (billionths of a meter). In living cells, however, natural chemical processes efficiently and precisely produce extremely complex structures below this size limit, so there may be hope of using some such processes to yield tiny molecules that can either function like transistors or be induced to combine with other materials in carefully controlled ways to construct whole nanocircuits. Much current research is aimed at harnessing DNA to this end, but materials chemist Angela Belcher and physicist Evelyn Hu are investigating a different molecular pattern maker: peptides, amino acid chains that are shorter than proteins.\n\nThe project grew out of Belcher's doctoral research on abalone. Her research group discovered in the mid-1990s that a specific peptide causes calcium carbonate to crystallize into the structure found only in the tough abalone shell. From that discovery, Belcher and Hu, Belcher's postdoctoral adviser at the time, realized that if they found peptides able to direct the crystal growth of the semiconductor materials that form transistors, they might have a tool for building nanoscale electronics. However, no known peptide was able to bind to semiconductor materials to cause the development of particular crystalline structures as some peptides did with calcium carbonate. So Belcher, Hu, and their colleagues grew a random assortment of one billion different peptides and tested whether any of them bound to silicon, gallium arsenide, or indium phosphide crystals—three widely used semiconductor materials. They found a few peptides that not only bound exclusively to one of the crystals in the experiment but also latched onto a particular face of the crystal. Through a process resembling accelerated evolution, they developed additional related peptides from those that had the initially promising characteristics.\n\nHu says that in order to use such a method to assemble a set of circuit-building tools it would be necessary to identify many additional organic compounds that bind to circuit-component materials. The group is making progress on that quest. As they have expanded their targets to 20 more semiconductor materials, their cache of crystal-manipulating peptides has ballooned into the hundreds. They are also designing new peptides that bind to two different crystals at once, acting as a daub of glue. It will take that kind of finesse at the nanoscale to produce self-assembling circuits.",

        "content": "Passage A\n\nIn 1940, Benjamin Lee Whorf seduced a whole generation into believing that our mother tongue restricts what we are able to think. In particular, Whorf announced, Hopi and English impose different pictures of reality on their speakers, impeding mutual understanding. Eventually, it transpired that there had never actually been any evidence to support his fantastic claims. Whorf's main mistake was to assume that our mother tongue prevents us from being able to think certain thoughts; new research suggests that in reality its influence consists in what it obliges us to think about. German, for example, forces me to designate my neighbor as male (Nachbar) or female (Nachbarin).\n\nFurthermore, grammatical genders can shape the feelings and associations that speakers have toward objects around them. In the 1990s, psychologists compared associations that speakers of German and Spanish make. There are many inanimate nouns whose genders in the two languages are reversed. A German bridge is feminine (die Brücke), for instance, but el puente is masculine in Spanish; and the same goes for clocks and violins. When speakers were asked about the characteristics of various objects, Spanish speakers deemed bridges, clocks, and violins to have stereotypically masculine properties like strength, but Germans tended to think of them as more slender or elegant. With objects like mountains or chairs, which are \"he\" in German but \"she\" in Spanish, the effect was reversed.\n\nPassage B\n\nStudies involving Pirahã and Mundurukú Indian subjects from the Brazilian Amazonia give evidence regarding the role of language in the development of numerical reasoning. The subjects in these reports apparently have consistent, unambiguous words for one and two and more loosely used words for three and four, but these subjects may not have true number words at all. Moreover, they do not overtly count, either with number words or by means of tallies. Yet, when tested on a variety of numerical tasks—naming the number of items in a stimulus set, constructing sets of equivalent number, judging which of two sets is more numerous, and mental addition and subtraction—the results appear to indicate that the subjects possess an innate imprecise nonverbal concept of number.\n\nIn showing that subjects with no verbal counting system have a concept of approximate numerical magnitude comparable to that of numerate subjects, these reports support a non-Whorfian, language-independent view of the origins of our concept of number. However, there is more to the story. Numerate subjects have a strong intuition of exact numerical equality. Two plus two is exactly four, not roughly four. When the innumerate subjects in these reports matched a set of four items to a set of five, or judged that 6 - 3 = 2, they gave evidence of being indifferent to exact numerical equality, an indifference not seen in numerate control subjects. Thus, the reports suggest that learning number words either creates a concept of exact numerical equality (a strong Whorfian hypothesis), or mediates the expansion of such a concept (a weaker Whorfian hypothesis), or directs attention to such a concept (a non-Whorfian hypothesis).",
